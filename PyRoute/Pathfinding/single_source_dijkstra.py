"""
Restarted single-source all-target Dijkstra shortest paths.

Lifted from networkx repo (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py)
as at Add note about using latex formatting in docstring in the contributorâ€¦  (commit a63c8bd).

Major modifications here are ripping out gubbins unrelated to the single-source all-targets case, and handling cases
where less than the entire shortest path tree needs to be regenerated due to a link weight change.

    """Find shortest weighted paths and lengths from a source node.

    Compute the shortest path length between source and all other
    reachable nodes for a weighted graph.

    Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths and lengths
    between a source and all other reachable nodes in a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node label
        Starting node for path

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
        If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    distances : dict of nodes, optional
        If provided, is assumed to be a dictionary of node-numeric pairs,
        reflecting the SPT distance from the node to source.
        Required with paths and/or frontier.

    paths : dict of nodes, optional
        If provided, is assumed to be a dictionary of node-list pairs,
        reflecting the already-found paths from the key node to the tree source.
        Required with distances and/or frontier.

    frontier : iterable of nodes, optional
        If provided, is assumed to be an iterable of nodes in distances to re-start
        the shortest-path search from.
        Required with distances and/or paths.

    Returns
    -------
    distance, path : pair of dictionaries, or numeric and list.
        The return value is a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by target nodes.
        The first dictionary stores distance to each target node.
        The second stores the path to each target node.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    Based on the Python cookbook recipe (119466) at
    https://code.activestate.com/recipes/119466/

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).

     Parameters
     ----------
     G : NetworkX graph

     source : non-empty iterable of nodes
         Starting node for paths. If this is just an iterable containing
         a single node, then all paths computed by this function will
         start from that node.

     paths: dict, optional (default=None)
         dict to store the path list from source to each node, keyed by node.
         If None, paths are not stored.

     cutoff : integer or float, optional
         Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
         If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    distances : dict of nodes, optional
        If provided, is assumed to be a dictionary of node-numeric pairs,

    frontier : iterable of nodes, optional
        If provided, is assumed to be an iterable of nodes in distances to re-start

     Returns
     -------
     distance : dictionary
         A mapping from node to shortest distance to that node from one
         of the source nodes.

    diagnostics : dictionary
        A dictionary containing the following entries:
        nodes_expanded : Number of nodes expanded during search
        nodes_queued : Number of nodes queued during search
        neighbours_checked : Number of node neighbours considered during search

     Raises
     ------
     NodeNotFound
         If any of `sources` is not in `G`.

     Notes
     -----
     The optional predecessor and path dictionaries can be accessed by
     the caller through the original pred and paths objects passed
     as arguments. No need to explicitly return pred or paths.
