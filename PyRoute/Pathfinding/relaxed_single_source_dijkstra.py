"""
Restarted single-source all-target Dijkstra shortest paths.

Lifted from networkx repo (https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/main/networkx/algorithms/shortest_paths/weighted.py)
as at Add note about using latex formatting in docstring in the contributorâ€¦  (commit a63c8bd).

Major modifications here are being able to start from an existing partial shortest-path tree after some subtree of it
has been removed (say an edge weight has changed) without requiring a full recalculation from scratch.
